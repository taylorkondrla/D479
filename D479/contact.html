            <h3>Frequently Requested Information</h3>
            <p>1. Plug into the island life with power outlets set at a friendly 120 voltsâ€”just like back in the States. Keep those devices charged for all your Taniti adventures!</p><br>
            <p>2. Here on Taniti, we've got a laid-back approach to serving alcohol. From midnight to 9:00 a.m., we're taking a break. The drinking age is 18, but hey, we're pretty easygoing about it. Enforce it? Not really our style.</p><br>

            <p>3. Younger Tanitians have got English down pat, but in the rural spots, especially with the wise elders, English might be a bit sparse. No worries, though; the island's charm speaks for itself.</p><br>

            <p>4. Feeling under the weather? Our hospital and clinics have got you covered. Plus, our hospital team is a diverse bunch, so you'll find plenty of friendly, multilingual faces.</p><br>             

            <p>5. Taniti's got good vibes, and violent crime is a rarity. But, like any growing tourist destination, keep an eye on your stuff. Reports of pickpocketing and other small-time mischief are on the rise.</p><br>

            <p>6. Taniti knows how to celebrate! But heads up, on national holidays, some attractions and restaurants might be catching a break too. Plan accordingly, so you don't miss out on the island festivities.</p><br>

            <p>7. Money talks on Taniti, and we're fluent in U.S. dollars. Euros and yen are cool too, and many places will happily accept them. Need some cash? Our banks are ready for currency exchange, and you can swipe those credit cards at most places.</p><br>
